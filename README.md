EcoDry 
Smart Solar Hybrid Dryer
Uses direct and indirect drying methods, direct using the UV screen, indirect using the heater and solar collector.
Temp sensor 1 monitors the temp of air in the solar collector and logs it, Temp sensor 2 monitors the temp and humidity in the drying chamber to keep it at the set temp for the particular crop and stop drying process when final humidity has been reached
Both fans work continuously, one at the inlet of the solar collector and the other at the exhaust of the dryer to keep airflow continuous.
Heater warms up air from the solar collector if the air isn't hot enough, heater draws a lot of current, hence only works for 30s at a time
RFID for security: RFID unlocks the solenoid and drying can only be initiated with the RFID to avoid tampering.
LED indicators for power and heater
OLED screen and buttons for display and selection
Web dashboard for remote monitoring.
